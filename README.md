# Kiyomi-Sato-MPT-Pack-Revised
An MPT implementation of Kiyomi Sato, an OC used in DDLC mods.

Version 1.0 - Initial Release
Version 1.1 - Added dress sprite, changed "peace" to "lpeace", & edited the "e2d" eyes

(I don't know who created the dress sprites, so please get into contact with me if you know the creator so that I can credit them!)
